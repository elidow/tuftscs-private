COMP 105: hw-opsem 

Eli Dow 

All three groups of problems have been correctly completed. There was no attempt
for the extra credit.

Emil Polakiewicz and I verbally shared general ideas for Part A and Part C.
Vichka Fonarev talked about what sections of eval.c that we could edit.

Shout out to TAs Emily Tran, Emily Gheewalla, and James Cameron for 
clarifying the directions for Parts B and C.

In general, directions were mostly clear, but Part C was a bit confusing 
considering that we had never proved a meta-theory with a counter-example.
