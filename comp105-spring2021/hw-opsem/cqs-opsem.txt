Reading comprehension for operational semantics
-----------------------------------------------
*Download* and edit this file, `cqs-opsem.txt`, to answer the
questions below. (It will render strangely in Canvas, which is oddly
stuck in the 20th century and cannot render Unicode characters.)
If your editor is not good with Greek letters, you can spell out their
names: ξ is $\xi$, ϕ is $\phi$, and ρ is $\rho$.

Once you've edited the file, submit it by uploading it to the homework
server and running command `submit105-cqs`.

For questions 1--7, please read pages 28--37 (the book sections on
environments and on operational semantics of expressions).
These questions are multiple-choice.

 1. $\xi$ (ξ) is an environment that maps names to

    (a) *only* user-defined functions.
    (b) *only* the values of formal parameters.
    (c) *both* primitive and user-defined functions.
    (d) the values of *both* global variables and formal parameters.
    (e) *only* primitive functions.
    (f) *only* the values of global variables.

 ANSWER: The answer is (f). Environment (ξ) only maps names to the values of global variables.

 2. $\phi$ (ϕ) is an environment that maps names to

    (a) *only* user-defined functions.
    (b) *only* the values of formal parameters.
    (c) *both* primitive and user-defined functions.
    (d) the values of *both* global variables and formal parameters.
    (e) *only* primitive functions.
    (f) *only* the values of global variables.

 ANSWER: The answer is (c). Environment (ϕ) maps to both primitive and user-definition functions

 3. $\rho$ (ρ) is an environment that maps names to

    (a) *only* user-defined functions.
    (b) *only* the values of formal parameters.
    (c) *both* primitive and user-defined functions.
    (d) the values of *both* global variables and formal parameters.
    (e) *only* primitive functions.
    (f) *only* the values of global variables.

 ANSWER: The answer is (b). Environment (ρ) only maps names to the values of formal parameters.

 4. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    metavariable $e$ stand for?

    (a) an environment
    (b) an Impcore variable
    (c) a function
    (d) an expression
    (e) a value
 
 ANSWER: The answer is (d), an expression.

 5. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    metavariable $v$ stand for?

    (a) an environment
    (b) an Impcore variable
    (c) a function
    (d) an expression
    (e) a value

 ANSWER: The answer is (e), a value.

 6. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    phrase "ρ{x ↦ 7}(x)" ($\rho\{x \mapsto 7\}(x)$) stand for?

    (a) an environment
    (b) an Impcore variable
    (c) a function
    (d) an expression
    (e) a value

 ANSWER: The answer is (e), a value.

 7. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    phrase "ρ{x ↦ 7}{x ↦ 8}" ($\rho\{x \mapsto 7\}\{x \mapsto 8\}$)
    stand for?

    (a) an environment
    (b) an Impcore variable
    (c) a function
    (d) an expression
    (e) a value

 ANSWER: The answer is (a), an environment

Questions 8 and 9 are also based on
pages 28--37.
Please answer a number.

 8. How many rules have the IF syntactic form in the conclusion?

 ANSWER: There are 2 rules with the IF syntactic form in the conclusion:
         The IfTrue form and the IfFalse form.

 9. How many rules have the APPLY syntactic form in the conclusion?

    (Count *all* the rules that are written in the section, not only 
    the rules in the summary on page 80.
    And count *only* the rules that are *written* in the section,
    not rules that are merely implied.)

 ANSWER: There are 5 rules with the APPLY syntactic form in the conclusion:
         ApplyUser, ApplyAdd, ApplyEqTrue, ApplyEqFalse, and ApplyPrintLn.

Now let's understand a subtle point about rules. Study the FormalVar
and FormalAssign rules starting on page 32.  In FormalVar, the initial
and final states have the same $\rho$ (ρ).  But in the FormalAssign rule,
there is an initial state with $\rho$ (ρ), an intermediate state with
$\rho'$ (ρ'), and a final state with ρ'{x ↦ v} ($\rho'\{x \mapsto v\}$).
Answer these questions:

10. In rule FormalVar, the initial and final state have the same $\rho$ (ρ) 
    because

    (a) Evaluating $x$ might change the value of some formal parameter.
    (b) Evaluating $x$ might not change the value of any formal parameter.
    (c) Evaluating $x$ doesn't change the value of any formal parameter.

 ANSWER: The answer is (c).
      
11. In rule FormalAssign, there is an intermediate state with $\rho'$ (ρ')
    (rho-prime) because

    (a) Evaluating $e$ might change the value of some formal parameter.
    (b) Evaluating $e$ might not change the value of any formal parameter.
    (c) Evaluating $e$ doesn't change the value of any formal parameter.

 ANSWER: The answer is (a).

12. Consider the sample derivation on page 58.
    The same $\rho$ (ρ) is used throughout the derivation because

    (a) Every subexpression is known, and because there is no unknown
        subexpression, there is no need for a $\rho'$ (ρ') (rho-prime).
    (b) No part of the evaluation changes the value of a formal parameter.
    (c) The example derivation takes a shortcut and doesn't actually
        conform to the rules.

 ANSWER: The answer is (b).
