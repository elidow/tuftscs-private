COMP 105: hw-impcore 

Eli Dow 

All three groups of problems and the challenge problem have been correctly
implemented, have documentation, and have adequate unit tests.

Emil Polakiewicz and I verbally brainstormed test cases for all problems.

The spec was very clear and had all necessary information. I did not use any of
the TAs for help on the assignment, but I will be sure to use them in the 
future.
