COMP 105: hw-scheme

Eli Dow 

All theory problems and coding problems have been completed. I completed the 
first extra-credit problem (TDP), but not the second.

Emil Polakiewicz and I verbally shared general ideas for Excercise A, flatten,
and arg-max. Elise cho and I discussed the possible inputs/cases for arg-max.

Shout out to TA Emily Gheewalla for helping me with a bug in arg-max and giving
other advice on my algebraic laws.

In general, directions were mostly clear, but I think that it should be
specified that 0 is included as a natural number in take/drop.
