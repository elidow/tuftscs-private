Acknowledgements: Together (Eli and Daniel) we wrote all of the code. We talked
over data structure design with Emil Polakiewicz and Ethan Schrieber. We talked
about the concept of atoms with Max Kaye and his partner Phillip. We got
help from multiple comp40 TAs in halligan (you guys are the best, thank you!).
We also consulted stack overflow for help understanding and pinpointing the
various valgrind errors that we got. 

Brightness.c has been correctly implemented. Readaline.c has been correctly
implemented for the version that handles all lines regardless of length.
Simlines.c has been correctly implemented. 

All of simlines is included in simlines.c. In simlines, if one of the files
can not be opened we continue on and try to access the rest of the files
provided. This prevents one bad file at the beginning ending the entire
program. If none of the provided files can be opened, nothing happens and it
ends happily. We broke up individual tasks into multiple functions, for example
pass_info handles readaline and collects its data and then table_maker puts the
data into our Table_T. For simplicity we also included our short struct 
definition of line_T in simlines.c

Time estimate: 25 hours, 2 mild panic attacks, and 1 chipped tooth.
