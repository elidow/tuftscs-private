We collaborated with Ethan Schreiber and Emil Pokaweicz on the
General design of unblackedges.c and discussed the benefits of BFS v. DFS.
We also received help from various TAs, and even Richard! Additionally,
we consulted stack overflow for help understanding various valgrind errors.

Unblackedges.c, Bit2.h and .c, UArray2.h and .c, and Sudoku.c, have all been
correctly implemented. For all cases they should perform as expected. 

We spent approximately 25-30 hours on this assignment.
